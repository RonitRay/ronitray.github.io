  <main class="post-content"><p>Tinkering is a trap, and I've fallen for it more times than I'm willing to admit.</p>
<p>It's so much fun to play around with a new window manager on Linux and spend hours and hours &quot;optimizing&quot; the configuration for &quot;maximum productivity&quot; or the &quot;smoothest workflow&quot;. Similarly, it's also too easy to play around with your site's CSS for hours and hours optimizing for some imaginary goal you'll never reach. The problem, of course, is diminishing returns.</p>
<p>When you get your hands on a new tool or adopt a new technology or framework, it's worth spending a short while getting used to it and molding it to suit your workflow. But beyond a certain point, the gains you get from playing around with it are minimal. <em>Always Be Customizing</em> is a favorite among my kind, because it allows you to feel like you're working when you really are not.</p>
<p>I started this site to develop a writing habit. Spending 3 hours playing around with templates and styling is not writing. Similarly, spending thousands on chairs, monitors, and keyboards to enhance productivity is great, as long as you can draw a finishing line and actually start being productive with these tools.</p>
<p>An important distinction: I'm not advocating for closed ecosystems that don't allow for any tinkering (looking at you, Apple and Windows). Cultivating self-restraint is much better than having your agency taken away by someone who thinks they know what you need better than you do.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and commit myself to working only inside my site's content and drafts folders. If that means setting the templates and styling-related files to readonly, I might just do that. Friction makes all the difference.</p>
