  <main class="post-content"><p>Something clicked recently and somehow made me enjoy the process of Java development a lot more than I have in the few years that I've actually been doing it professionally.
With this comes a desire to actually engage in it a bit more academically and be more design-conscious of the decisions I am making on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>I am also tired of learning from tutorials and articles, and want to have a deeper engagement with the work I do.</p>
<p>This is a list of books on Java people online seem to value, and I intend to read them sometime in the near future.</p>
