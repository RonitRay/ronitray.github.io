  <main class="post-content"><h5>Personal note: I love football. I didn't get into the game very early in my life, but since age 12 or so, I have been absolutely obsessed. Earlier this year, I got a subscription to <a href="https://theathletic.com/">The Athletic</a> and was exposed to some of the best football coverage I've ever read. While I cannot afford the subscription anymore, I still have access to a lot of their content through podcasts and partner YouTube channels like the excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TifoFootball">Tifo Football</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TifoIRL">Tifo IRL</a>. Tom Worville, their data analytics writer, has consistently put out superb work that is informative and interesting. More recently, he has featured in a series of videos by Tifo, comparing players in Europe's top leagues across several dimensions using scattergrams.</h5>
<h5>Very recently, Tom has signed as a Data Scientist for RB Leipzig, one of the hottest projects in Europe (Congratulations, Tom!). I think it's fair to say his work has impressed me and maybe even inspired me to dip my toes in the field. Thankfully, Worville himself and a number of awesome people on Twitter have compiled more resources than I can get through in quite some time. This post is an attempt to document the same. 99% of the effort is from the people who actually created the materials and compiled them. All I have done is removed Twitter's stupid tracking links and cleaned up the formatting a little so it's actually readable. I will hopefully be visiting some of these materials in the future and writing about what I learn from them.</h5>

<p>Some good advice from <a href="https://twitter.com/smarterscout">@smarterscout</a> in <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xMTAyMDYxLnJzcw/episode/QnV6enNwcm91dC00NDI5NTMy?hl=en-GB&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiI2OzLt7jqAhXVoFwKHcQ2ASYQjrkEegQIBxAE&amp;ep=6">this podcast ep about getting into the industry, along with the much needed about the relatively few jobs on offer</a></p>
<p>Another plug for <a href="https://twitter.com/rweekly_org">@rweekly_org</a>, this week is by the great <a href="https://twitter.com/R_by_Ryo">@R_by_Ryo</a> Including - Creating an xG model with R <a href="https://twitter.com/thecomeonman">@thecomeonman</a>'s arsenal of code examples</p>
<p><a href="https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/08/spreadsheets-using-r/">This</a> is a gentle how-to guide for those who are approaching R from being excel users first and foremost.</p>
<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ten-up-to-date-ways-to-do-common-data-tasks-in-r-4f15e56c92d">This</a> is a great <code>#Rstats</code> guide to making the most of recent changes to the {tidyverse} Big one for me is relocating columns in a dataframe, which dplyr::relocate() can help with now. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_keithmcnulty">@dr_keithmcnulty</a>!</p>
<p>The great <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_mock">@thomas_mock</a> has been on a TEAR recently with some nice blogs on building better tables using {gt}, but more relevant is <a href="https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-28-heatmaps-in-ggplot2/">this well thought out piece on heatmap design.</a></p>
<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/icymi_r">@icymi_r</a> which is a great <code>#rstats</code> content aggregator.</p>
<p>Not posted here for a while, but <a href="https://twitter.com/JanVanHaaren">@JanVanHaaren</a>'s <a href="https://janvanhaaren.be/2020/12/30/soccer-analytics-review-2020.html">excellent summary of football analytics in 2020</a> is well worth a read:</p>
<p>Feel it’s quite common that people have “coding scrapbooks” of functions/tips they return to over and over again. <a href="https://gustasam5.medium.com/some-useful-python-stuff-92f0b013c9a4">Sam’s here is neat</a></p>
<p>Had a couple of DMs asking about coding tutorials. Have to say that <a href="https://twitter.com/mckayjohns">@mckayjohns</a> is the GOAT, and a great place to get started</p>
<p>Also<a href="https://twitter.com/Soccermatics">@Soccermatics</a>' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBFJYcag8j2rm_9HkrrA7w">Friends of Tracking channel</a> has tons too.</p>
<p>Just stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/eddwebster/football_analytics">this Github repo</a> of links and various resources by <a href="https://twitter.com/eddwebster">@eddwebster</a>, unbelievable effort to keep on top of all of this.</p>
<p>Great work by <a href="https://twitter.com/PfaffCatherine">@PfaffCatherine</a> pulling a list together of <a href="https://mast.queensu.ca/~cpfaff/FemaleSportsAnalysts.pdf">female identifying sports analysts</a>, hopefully serves as inspiration to others + good to spotlight those succeeding in such a male-dominated industry.</p>

<p>Reminder: there are hundreds of great, FREE learning resources for <code>#rstats</code> out there. There's no need to sign up to take courses with a disgusting, ethically bankrupt company with sniveling, feckless leadership.</p>
<p>I'm completely self-taught in R. Here's a list of the FREE, OPEN materials I've used on my journey: For data wrangling and visualization, nothing beats <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz">Hadley's &quot;R for Data Science&quot;</a></p>
<p>Want to learn about data visualization? Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/ClausWilke">@ClausWilke</a>'s <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/">&quot;Fundamentals of Data Visualization&quot;</a>. While not a book about R specifically, it's a great resource for learning what makes a good, interpretable viz. Plus, the book's code is available!</p>
<p>If you want to learn about ggplot2 plotting in particular, it's best to get it straight from the source: read Hadley's ggplot2: <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/">Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis</a>. I can't imagine why you'd want to learn it from anyone else.</p>
<p>For diving into the internals of R, <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz">Hadley's &quot;Advanced R&quot;</a> is a wonderful resource. I've gone back to it several times over the years and found new nuggets of info. Confused about environments or closures, or how to debug C code or NSE? Check it out. The second edition of &quot;Advanced R&quot; is available at a <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz">slightly different URL</a></p>
<p>Want to learn about maps, GIS, and spatial analysis and visualization? Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/robinlovelace">@robinlovelace</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/jakub_nowosad">@jakub_nowosad</a>'s <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/">&quot;Geocomputation with R&quot;</a>, a great free resource on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.</p>
<p>Want to learn how to spin up your own data analysis cluster and do work on &quot;big data&quot; in R? Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/javierluraschi">@javierluraschi</a>'s <a href="https://therinspark.com/">&quot;Mastering Spark with R.&quot;</a> He even shows you how to fire up a rayrender render farm for complex 3D visualizations!</p>
<p>If you like the &quot;in person&quot; learning experience video provides and you're interested in learning more about making maps in R with rayshader, check out my open and free masterclass I taught with the <a href="https://twitter.com/PennMUSA">@PennMUSA</a> program:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://penniur.upenn.edu/events/musamasterclass-featuring-tyler-morgan-wall-3d-mapping-dataviz-in-r">Course</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tylermorganwall/MusaMasterclass">Code</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the R community is the best—if you ever run into seemingly intractable problems on your journey, tweet your issue with the <code>#rstats</code> hashtag &amp; almost certainly you'll get help. And if that fails, try the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">community forums hosted by RStudio</a></p>
<p>I'd add <a href="https://socviz.co/">Kieran Healy's Data Visualization</a>, available in a free online format as well as a textbook.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://rfordatasci.com">awesome Slack group</a> to help work through the book (and help on all other R questions as well). People are really helpful and friendly!</p>
<p>Learn about solve text mining problems with <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">&quot;Text Mining with R&quot;</a>! Great introduction to the tidytext package and working with text data by <a href="https://twitter.com/juliasilge">@juliasilge</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">@drob</a></p>

<p>Have you checked out<a href="https://twitter.com/dcossyle">@dcossyle</a>'s teacup giraffes and stats? I think it is definitely high schooler friendly! https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/</p>
